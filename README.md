# ionic-reddit-gallery
A simple reddit gallery made in Ionic. Based on the HTTP Ionic tutorial by Josh Morony available [here](https://www.joshmorony.com/using-http-to-fetch-remote-data-from-a-server-in-ionic-2/), but altered further.
The goal is to turn this into a more customizable Reddit Gallery app.

## WHAT DOES IT DO?

- Shows 10 images from the /r/EarthPorn subreddit (don't worry, it's not really porn - just beautiful landscape images from various locations)
- Nothing else (bummer, I know)

## TO-DO
- Alter initial screen to something else other than a specific subreddit (maybe a random subreddit from several configured by default, I dunno)
- Allow users to subscribe subreddits to the app (right now it's hardcoded to load images from /r/EarthPorn)
- Improve user interaction adding things like the option to download the image, etc. (right now the user only visualizes the images)
- More listing options (order from hot or top, listing limits bigger than 10)
